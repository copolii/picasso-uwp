# picasso-uwp
A .NET (UWP) port of Square's Picasso library (https://github.com/square/picasso) written in C#, targeting the Universal Windows Platform.
#Status
Do not use. Development has just started (April 2, 2016). This readme will be updated when the project reaches alpha. This shouldn't take long as I need this functionality in another project that I'm working on.
# Contributions
While I will definitely need help completing this, I'm not accepting contributions _at this time_ (can't improve what doesn't yet exist, right?). Once the project reaches a usable (not perfect) state, I'll update this note.
